### Gaming Backlog Tracker

This spreadsheet presents a table of my current video game backlog. 
For anyone interested as to how I created this, I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in conjunction with [DataTables](https://datatables.net) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com) (CSS + some html knowledge needed).

### Information

Most of the games on this backlog will take me days to fully complete; I tend to try to ~90-100% a game rather than rush through it (which is what causes most of these games to appear on the backlog in the first place).

If you want to suggest a game for me to play, just ask if I have already played it when I am live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/anmelus), if I like the game I might add it here or just play it on the spot!

* In the future, I may append this tracker to include information about every single game I have played + my personal review and score.
