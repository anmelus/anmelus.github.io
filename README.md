### Gaming Backlog Tracker

You can access my gaming backlog with the keys "CtrlLeft + ShiftLeft + AltLeft"
This spreadsheet presents a table of my current video game backlog. 
I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in conjunction with [DataTables](https://datatables.net) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com) (CSS + some html knowledge needed).

### Information

Most of the games on this backlog will take me days to fully complete; I tend to try to ~90-100% a game rather than rush through it (which is what causes most of these games to appear on the backlog in the first place).

* In the future, I may turn this into a blog and personal reviews.
